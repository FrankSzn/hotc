These are the pretty and typeset versions of my notes from 15-417,
higher order type compilation. It is being taught at CMU during the
fall of 2015 by Karl Crary.

There is no SML code in here, nothing specific to implementation
beyond what is covered in lectures. It's intended to be a
serialization of the lecture supplemented with my own notes. I've
attempted to distinguish what is just brought up by me.

These notes are unofficial and aren't guaranteed for correctness or
completeness though I will do my best.
